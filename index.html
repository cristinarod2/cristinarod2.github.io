    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Research Program Manager at UBC’s Molecular Imaging Research Facility, 
        specializing in advanced preclinical imaging with a clear focus on PET, SPECT, and CT. 
        My work bridges imaging science, radiochemistry, and quantitative analysis to enable 
        high-impact translational research.
        <br><br>
        I design and lead complex in vivo and ex vivo imaging workflows, develop 
        rigorous quantification pipelines, and collaborate closely with multidisciplinary teams 
        to bring molecular imaging projects from concept to publication.
        <br><br>
        Beyond research management, I build custom Python tools and automated platforms that make 
        laboratory workflows smarter, faster, and more reproducible — from tumour-tracking apps 
        and radiotracer QC dashboards to 3D Slicer integrations and radioactive inventory systems.
